# Overview of Election Audit 
### The purpose of this election audit is to provide information to the Colorado Board of Elections for a recent congressional election. 

### Election Audit Results 
In the recent congressional election held in Colorado, there were a total 369,711 votes cast. The three counties that comprise the precinct are Jefferson, Denver and Arapahoe. 

In the precinct, there were 306,055 votes cast in Denver (82.8% of the total votes cast), 38,855 votes cast in Jefferson County (10.5% of the total votes cast), and 24,801 votes cast in Arapahoe (6.7% of tht total votes cast). 

Denver had the largest number of votes of the three counties and Diana DeGette won the election. 

The three candidates were as follows: 
Diana DeGette (272,892) *Representing 73.8% of the popular vote

Charles Casper Stockham (85,213) *Representing 23% of the popular vote.

Raymon Anthony Doane (11,606) *Representing 3.1% of the popular vote. 

### Methods
First, the county name was captured from each row and checked against the county list with an "if" statement. If not, then the county name is added to the list. The County vote and percentages were initialized to zero. Then a vote is added to the county's vote count as the rows are looped through (this was also done with the candidate names)

Next, a for loop was used to get each county from the county dictionary and the percentage of the votes for the county. This was modeled on the vote count and percentage (county_vote divided by total_votes). 

A text file was utilized in order to create an Election Results summary using a "with open" command.

### Election-Audit Summmary 
This script is flexible and can be adapted for any type of election, obviously with other states another dictionary could be added to include candidates' votes and percentages there. We could also use this code in local state races such as school board elections or Clerk of Circuit Court elections. In both cases, the counties would be changed to zip codes in order to get the total votes in each zip code and the percentage of votes for each candidate.
