# Election_Analysis
(Python Introduction) 
## Learning Targets
Create scripts that read, write and store data. 
Perform mathematical calculations. 
Use decision statements, logical operations for complex comparisons and repetitive statements to run code more than once. 
Produce screen output. 

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. 

Provide the following in a report: 
1. Total number of votes cast in the election. 
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes. 
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received. 
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won. 
5. Determine the einner of the election based on popular vote. 

## Resources 
- Data from election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1, VS Code, 1,38.1

## Challenge Overview 
Include the following additional information in the election analysis by using for loops and conditional statements with membership and logical operators: 
1. The total voter turnout for each county 
2. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
3. The county with the highest turnout

Provide a written analysis of the election audit for the election commission, including the additional information and a clearly written overview of your methods.
